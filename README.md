# AI-Based-Threat-Prediction
This project uses AI to monitor network traffic and detect security threats, such as hacking or malware. It learns normal behavior patterns and sends real-time alerts for suspicious activity. Using Random Forest and SVM models, it offers accurate threat detection and will be enhanced with deep learning for even better performance
