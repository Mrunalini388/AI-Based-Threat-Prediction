# AI-Based Threat Prediction

This project uses Artificial Intelligence to monitor network traffic and detect security threats such as hacking, malware, and other intrusions. By learning patterns of normal network behavior, the system can identify suspicious activity and issue real-time alerts.

# Key Features

- Detects threats based on traffic patterns  
-  Learns normal behavior using machine learning  
-  Sends real-time alerts for anomalies  
-  Implements **Random Forest** and **SVM** for high-accuracy detection  
-  Future integration of **Deep Learning** for enhanced performance

# Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- Random Forest, SVM  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE for class balancing)

# Future Enhancements

- Integration of deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, CNN)  
- Live traffic capture and real-time threat dashboard  
- Model tuning and threat prioritization logic
